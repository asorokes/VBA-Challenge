# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 of GW Data Analytics Bootcamp

The intention of this assignment is to create a VBA script that can run through stock data for 2018, 2019, and 2020. 
    
Instructions:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

Contained in this Repository:
1) the "VBA Challenge Stock Data Analysis" file. This contains the stock data, as well as the VBA script.
2) A separate file containing the VBA Code for easier reading/access.
3) Screen shots of the results for the years of 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Code/script for this assignment was created using resources from class, tutors, online web reserach, and collaborative work with classmates.
